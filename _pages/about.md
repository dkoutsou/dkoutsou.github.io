Hi! I am a PhD student in the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), supervised by [Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/) and [Ana Klimovic](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/). I am broadly interested in database systems and more specifically on how we can execute database workloads on heterogeneous architectures (RDMA, serverless, NVM)  and adapt the next generation of DBMSs in the cloud. More recently, I am looking into using compiler infrastructure like MLIR for databases and how we can optimize data layouts for serverless databases.

I hold a MSc in Data Science from ETH Zurich. Before coming to ETH, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [National Technical University of Athens](). In the past, I have worked for [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), [Orfium](https://orfium.com/), [Maastricht University](https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/RAI/) and I have collaborated with [Microsoft Gray Systems Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/gray-systems-lab/).
